   <abstract>
     <t>The cryptographic algorithm and key size requirements included when DKIM
     was designed in the last decade are functionally obsolete and in need of
     immediate revision.  This document updates DKIM requirements to those
     minimaly suitable for operation with currently specified algorithms.  This
     document updates RFC 6376.</t>

          <t hangText="Discussion Venue:  ">Discussion about this draft is directed to the

	 </list></t>
     <t><xref target="RFC6376">DKIM</xref> signs e-mail messages, by creating hashes of the message
	headers and content and signing the header hash with a digital signature.
	Message recipients fetch the signature verification key from the DNS where it is
	stored in a TXT record.
	The defining documents specify a single signing algorithm, <xref target="RFC8017">RSA</xref>,
	and recommends key sizes of 1024 to 2048 bits (but require verification of 512 bit keys).
        As discussed in <xref target="VULNOTE">US-CERT VU#268267</xref>, the operational
        community has recognized that shorter keys compromise the effectiveness of DKIM.
	While 1024 bit signatures are common, stronger signatures are not.  Widely used DNS
        configuration software places a practical limit on key sizes, because the software only
        handles a single 256 octet string in a TXT record, and RSA keys longer than 1024 bits don't
        fit in 256 octets.

     <t>The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
	"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
	<xref target="RFC2119" />.</t>

   <section title="DKIM Signing and Verification Algorithms">
     <t>This section replaces <xref target="RFC6376"/> Section 3.3 in its
     entirety.</t>
     
     <t>Generally, DKIM supports multiple digital signature algorithms.  One
     algorithms, rsa-sha256, is currenlty defined.  Signers MUST implement and
     sign using rsa-sha256.  Verifiers MUST implement rsa-sha256.</t>

   <section title="The rsa-sha256 Signing Algorithm">
     <t>The rsa-sha256 Signing Algorithm computes a message hash as described in
     <xref target="RFC6376"/>, Section 3.7 using SHA-256 [FIPS-180-3-2008] as
     the hash-alg.  That hash is then signed by the Signer using the RSA
     algorithm (defined in PKCS#1 version 1.5 <xref target="RFC8017"/>) as the
     crypt-alg and the Signer's private key.  The hash MUST NOT be truncated or
     converted into any form other than the native binary form before being
     signed.  The signing algorithm SHOULD use a public exponent of 65537.</t>
   </section>

   <section title="Key Sizes">
   <t>Selecting appropriate key sizes is a trade-off between cost,
   performance, and risk.  Since short RSA keys more easily succumb to
   off-line attacks, Signers MUST use RSA keys of at least 1024 bits for
   all keys.  Verifiers MUST be able to validate signatures with
   keys ranging from 1024 bits to 4096 bits, and they MAY be able to
   validate signatures with larger keys.  Verifier policies can use the
   length of the signing key as one metric for determining whether a
   signature is acceptable.</t>

   <t>Factors that should influence the key size choice include the
       following:
       
   <list style="symbols">
       <t>The practical constraint that large (e.g., 4096-bit) keys might
       not fit within a 512-byte DNS UDP response packet</t>

       <t>The security constraint that keys smaller than 2048 bits may be
       subject to off-line attacks</t>

       <t>Larger keys impose higher CPU costs to verify and sign email</t>

       <t>Keys can be replaced on a regular basis; thus, their lifetime can
       be relatively short</t>

       <t>The security goals of DKIM,<xref target="RFC6376"/>, are modest
       compared to typical goals of other systems that employ digital
       signatures</t>
   </list></t>

   <t>See <xref target="RFC3766"/> for further discussion on selecting key
   sizes.</t>
   </section>

   <section title="Other Algorithms">

   <t>Other algorithms will be defined in the future.  Verifiers MUST ignore
   any signatures using algorithms that they do not implement.</t>

   <section title="The DKIM-Signature Header Field">
     <t>This section updates the a= tag in <xref target="RFC6376"/> Section 3.5.</t>
     <t>The text description of the tag is now:
      <list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
      <t hangText="a="> The algorithm used to generate the signature (plain-text;
      REQUIRED).  Verifiers MUST support "rsa-sha256"; Signers MUST sign using
      "rsa-sha256".  See <xref target="RFC6376"/> Section 3.3 (as updated by this
      document) for a description of the algorithms.</t>

   <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t> This document does not change the Security Considerations of
      <xref target="RFC6376"/>.  It reduces the risk of signature compromise
      due to weak cryptography.  The SHA-1 risks discussed in
      <xref target="RFC6194"/> Section 3 are resolved due to the removal of
      rsa-sha1 from DKIM.</t>
